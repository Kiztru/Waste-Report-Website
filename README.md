# Marine Waste Reporting Website ðŸŒŠ

This web application enables users to **report marine waste** and classify its type using a **machine learning model** built with [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). The project was developed to raise awareness of marine pollution and support environmental monitoring efforts.

---

## Features

- **Interactive map:** Powered by [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for pinpointing waste locations.  
- **Report form:** Submit detailed information including waste type, location coordinates, and additional notes.  
- **Server-side database:** Reports are stored using PHP and MySQL for later analysis.  
- **Responsive design:** Accessible on both desktop and mobile browsers.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js  
- **Backend:** PHP for form handling and validation  
- **Database:** MySQL (or any PHP-compatible database)

## How It Works

1. **Select waste location on the map.**  
2. **Upload an image** (optional) or choose waste type manually.  
3. **ML model runs classification** if an image is provided.  
4. **Form is validated client-side and server-side** via PHP.  
5. **Data is stored in the database** for environmental tracking and analysis.
